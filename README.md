# proxyAuth
ProxyAuth is a Linux PAM to authenticate a GNOME desktop via a Bluetooth device. This is similar to Apple's Autlo Unlock feature where one can use their phone or watch 
to unlock their Macbook. **Please do not consider using this software for personal use yet as it is still in development phase.** 

**tldr:** A Linux & Android implementation to Apple's Auto Unlock feature.

**Status:** Inactive

There has been no active development nor interest after the course ended. Feel 
free to fork the project, open issues and suggest changes. I will be making 
minor changes once in a while to clean up the code and play around.

**2021-08-25:** Project is still inactive but there are some planned features to be released in 12 months from now:
* An entire rewrite of the android application
* Integration of development tools (i.e. CI support via Github Actions, Doxygen for documentation, static analyzers, and testing suite)
* Security enhancements (`SECURITY.md` will detail security fixes)
* Support for Fedora (should be minimal changes since uses the same Graphical Desktop Environment)
